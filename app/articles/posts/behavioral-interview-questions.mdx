Behavioral interview questions are designed to understand how you've handled situations in the past to predict your future performance. These questions often start with phrases like "Tell me about a time when..." or "Give me an example of..."

## The STAR Method

The **STAR method** is the gold standard for answering behavioral questions:

- **Situation**: Set the context
- **Task**: Explain what you needed to accomplish
